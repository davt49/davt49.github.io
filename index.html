      <div class="has-text-centered">
        Coming from a Fine Arts degree, I’ve always been creative and self-motivated. I enjoy being able to have the skills to make new, interesting things.
        <br/><br/>
        I first discovered coding from data science and SQL through a work placement at a Corporate Data Intelligence team, but I quickly realised software development is what I really wanted to do, and it is actually closer to my background in the Arts.
        <br/><br/>
        I attended the Software Engineering course at General Assembly to learn and practice full stack software development. Whilst there I’ve worked in team projects, coordinating the project on trello, managing Git branching, as well as picking up a huge amount of development toolkit on JavaScript and Python on a very intensive schedule.
        <br/><br/>
        Now with multiple creative projects, I’m feeling excited about working as a junior full stack Developer.

                      It’s been a lot of fun working on a website for Radiohead. It is a band that meant a lot to me when I was younger so I put in a lot of work on the Seeds file to make sure the images relate to the time period of the song, lyric snippets etc. Using Python Flask I set up an original API for a React Frontend. There are a lot of planning and work on the seeds file. Music player works as well.

                    <br/>
                    <p>We built a MERN stack website that users can log in, post pictures about a country, like and comment on pictures, follow other users as well as having a language option that translates the specific chat section. Trello worked very well for us to set up what we need to do for each part of the day, and was very much on time with schedule all the way through.
                    <br/><br/>

                    The project was originally made for <span><a href="https://vietgram-ga.herokuapp.com/">Vietnam</a></span>, a popular holiday destination. After the course I re-designed the website to Germany and deployed it with a new name.

                  <p>I built Tetris on vanilla JavaScript. File structure is simply HTML, CSS and JavaScript as it’s vanilla without frameworks. Using a numbered board, I arranged different classes for the block shapes to travel around the board by altering their number (location) on every action.
